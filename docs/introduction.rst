What's in it for you?
=====================

Agilicious is split in two parts, *agilib* and *agiros*.

*agilib* contains base classes and module implementations providing the base functionality necessary for agile flight.
It contains controllers, estimators, and logic, but with minimal dependencies (mainly `Eigen <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page>`__).
It allows users to integrate Agilicious into their own infrastructure and can easily be extended with new modules.
Meanwhile, *agiros* provides bindings to common `ROS <https://www.ros.org>`__ interfaces, which make it easy and quick to set up and get flying, both in simulation and real world.

In summary, this library offers the following modules:

===========
Pipelines
===========

The Pipeline architecture provides a modular way to combine controllers, estimators, reference trajectories into a complete control system.
It is posible to create multiple pipelines and switch between them at runtime, allowing rapid prototyping.

============
Controllers
============

- Model Predictive Control descred in `Falanga IROS'18 <https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/IROS18_Falanga.pdf>`_ and `Sun TRO'22 <https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/Arxiv21_MPC_Sun.pdf>`_
- Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion described in `Sun TRO'20 <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9160894>`_
- Geometric Control described in `Sun TRO'22 <https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/Arxiv21_MPC_Sun.pdf>`_
- Cascaded PID similar to `Faessler RAL'18 <https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/RAL18_Faessler.pdf>`_

==========
Estimators
==========

- A standard EKF using a pose estimate and propagating with IMU measurements.
- An EKF that uses a constant acceleration model and the Pose + IMU measurements.
- A feedthrough module that provides a simple way to pipe in your own estimate sources.
- A mock estimator that can corrupt an estimate with noise and bias to simulate real-world properties.

==========
References
==========

- Hover
- Velocity Commands
- Sampled Trajectories
- Polynomial Trajectories

========
Samplers
========
- Time-based sampling along a given reference.
- Positional sampling along a given reference which allows to robustly handle large disturbances.

=======
Bridges
=======

- `RotorS <https://github.com/ethz-asl/rotors_simulator>`_ interface
- Serial bridge to interface with our own flight control software
- Serial bridge to interface through `LAIRD <https://www.lairdconnect.com>`_ wireless modules.
- Serial bridge to interface with `BetaFlight controllers <https://betaflight.com>`_.

=====
Pilot
=====

The Pilot handles all logic, interfacing, and provides a capable API for quadrotor control.

=====
Guard
=====
A safety guard implementation that can use a secondary estimate (e.g. motion capture) and take over if some criteria are invalidated.
The guard can use a secondary pipeline configuration without relying on the user-defined modules.
This allows for rapid prototyping with a virtual "safety net".

=========
Simulator
=========
A sophisticated and configurable simulation that runs magnitudes faster than real time and optionally provides aerodynamic BEM models as described in `Bauersfeld RSS'21 <https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/RSS21_Bauersfeld.pdf>`__.
